"""This module runs the GUI that allows analysts to add modifiers to reports and to double check/change header data.
There is no way to change the actual data from the GUI, only header information (which is almost never parsed 100%
correctly, currently - Feb 11, 2020). The analyst can also pick which of the 6 types of reports they want, and can enter
additional information (mass of a gummy/cookie/capsule, density values) that report type needs to be produced. """
