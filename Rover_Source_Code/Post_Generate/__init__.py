"""This module contains the code that takes the manipulated data, with user inputs from the GUI, and creates latex files
that can be opened up using TeXnicCenter or any other Latex/Tex processor. Converting this file to PDF will produce a
finished lab report that can be sent out to clients. The two broad categories of reports are basic and deluxe, which
refers to the amount of Cannabinoids reported. Each report will be one of these two, and will also have analytes
reported in either percent, mass/volume, or per capsule/candy/cookie. This means there are 6 different types of potency
reports possible. The customer can also request one sample per page, or multiple samples per page."""
