"""This module contains all of the code that runs prior to the generation of Latex Files. It is responsible for reading
xml data, parsing out blank and standard recovery information, parsing out the individual samples and swapping
out-of-calibration data with in-calibration data from sample dilutions. It also parses header information and combines
this information with the appropriate samples."""
